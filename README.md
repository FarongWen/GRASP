# Are Your LLMs Specialized Generalists?
## Abstract
Early large language models (LLMs) aim for broad, general-purpose goals, yet the shift toward expert-domain applications soon gives way to the rise of specialized models. As the field evolves, there is a growing demand for models that combine strong specialization with broad generality. However, most current LLM benchmarks still lean toward either one side or the other, which makes it difficult to effectively measure the comprehensive performance of models in terms of both specialized and general capabilities. To bridge this gap, we propose the **G**ene**ra**l–**S**pecialized Evaluation **P**aradigm (GRASP). GRASP integrates capability data from diverse leaderboards to provide a comprehensive view of models’ general and specialized strengths. Our analysis shows a significant imbalance between these two capabilities in existing LLMs and also identifies direct correlations that link them.
